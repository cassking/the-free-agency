## Demo
Try it out here: <a href="https://the-free-agency.herokuapp.com/">The Free Agency</a>

We implemented external API to get playersâ€™ information and seed it to the database, allowing users to
see most recent data

We utilized Model Serializers to filter data entries from the Postgres database into the React Router
Controller

The back-end in implemented in Ruby on Rails, serving as API endpoints and we used React  for the  front end.
